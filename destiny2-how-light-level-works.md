# How Light Level Works in Destiny 2

In the first 6 months I spent playing Destiny, I found light level really confusing. Here's a simple guide to light level that will help you understand where and why light level matters, why there are actually three light levels that matter, and how to increase your light level.

## Light Level

Light level seems simple at first. It's displayed in a huge font basically everywhere your name shows up. The calculation is straightforward, it's the average light level of the items you have equipped, plus the seasonal artifact bonus.  When you equip items that increase your average light level, it goes up. When the seasonal artifact levels up, it goes up. This is the light level that applies when your light level is compared to the recommended light level for PVE activities.

### Base Light Level

Base light level is the average of the items you currently have equipped. The light level bonus from the seasonal artifact is left out. This light level is applied when you engage in PVP activities where light level applies, like Iron Banner or Trials of Osiris.

### Maximum Light Level

This is the light level your character would have if they equipped all of the highest light level items from your account, whether they're in the character's inventory, in the vault, or even in the inventory of your other characters. It's calculated by averaging the highest light level value item available for each slot. It is class dependent, so if your highest Titan helm is 1200, and your highest Hunter helm is 1050, your Hunter's maximum light level for that slot will be 1050. If your highest Kinetic Weapon is 1200, that will apply to all of the characters on your account. Maximum Light Level is used as the base for calculating the light level of rewards and drops.

## Great, So What Do You Do With This Info?

The important questions are, what things do you need to keep, and when do you need to use Upgrade Modules to Infuse your items. Everybody probably already knows this, but if you're infusing an item with a higher light level version of the same item, it just costs a bit of Glimmer, so you should always do it.

### PVE Activities

All PVE activities have a recommended light level, and if your Light Level is below the recommended light level, you both do less damage to enemies and take more damage from enemies. This is a clever way (from a game design perspective) to have the difficulty of various activities scale down over the course of a season so that they become accessible to less skilled players along the way. Here's [one plot](https://imgur.com/a/45Qnh6n) that shows the damage penalty for being below the recommended light level for an activity. Your damage drops by roughly 1% for every point of light level you're below the recommendation.

In some activities, it also helps to be over the recommended power level, for at least a little while. (Theories on how much it helps and what the cap is vary.) The bottom line, though, is that while it can help to be above the recommendation, activities rapidly become more difficult the farther you are below the recommendation. In terms of upgrades, you should focus on upgrading weapons and armor you want to use in various activities to a light level at or above the recommendation for that activity.

There are some activities (raids and difficult Nightfalls) that have a light level requirement. You can't even participate if you're not above the required light level, so you'll have to upgrade the equipment you'll be using until you're above the light level required for the event.

Light level also matters at the item level for weapons. There are damage penalties (and maybe bonuses) based on the light level of the weapon relative the light level of your enemies, so prioritize upgrading weapons ahead of armor.

### PVP Activities

In the Destinations view, you can see whether light advantages are enabled or disabled for each activity. If they're disabled, you can ignore light level entirely. This is the case for most PVP activities. Light advantages are enabled for activities like Iron Banner. If you engage in those activities, you should upgrade the equipment you'll be using to the highest light level you can.

Gambit is weird. Light level does not affect PVE fighting, but does affect PVP fighting (invasions). Apparently the actual effect on PVP fights is quite small, however, so there's no need to worry much about light level.

### Maximizing Your Light Level Gains

The good news on the light level grinding front is that all you have to do keep growing your light level is hang onto the highest light level item you obtain for every slot, even if you just throw it in your vault. That's 18 items – 5 pieces of armor per class and 3 weapons. I'll talk about the caps on light level increases a bit later on, but basically, as long as you hang onto your highest light level items and you keep doing activities that can increase your light level, your light level will go up. In other words, there's no need to ever infuse items (and use Upgrade Modules) to increase your maximum light level.

If you only play "Light advantages disabled" activities (like Crucible) you could theoretically reach the hard cap for the season on light level without upgrading a single item above the base level for the season.

The one thing you must avoid is dismantling your highest light level items, because doing so can lower your Maximum Light level. 

## Rewards and Caps

There are four power levels that come into play when you're leveling up. 

* The season cap, which is 1260 for the Season of the Hunt
* The powerful cap, after which powerful rewards will no longer increase your light level, that's 1250
* The soft cap, beyond which regular drops won't increase your light level, 1200
* The base light level for the season – 1050

Getting from 1050 to 1200 is straightforward. Every drop will be above your maximum light level, even blue items. You just need to keep doing stuff and to hang onto the highest light level item for each slot. This is the magical time when every drop is a winner.

When you hit the soft cap (light level 1200), only Powerful or Pinnacle rewards will reward items that are above your current Maximum Light Level, so you'll need to obtain those rewards to keep growing your Light Level. Blueberries.gg has a list of [Powerful and Pinnacle reward activities](https://www.blueberries.gg/leveling/destiny-2-max-power-level/) that you can reference. Most of these are weekly activities. Once you've hit the soft cap, just do as many weekly activities with powerful (or pinnacle rewards) as you can each week, and hang onto the light level upgrades. Remember that all of these rewards are based on your maximum light level.

For people who are hyper-optimizing to get ready for raiding on day one or whatever, there's a strategy that involves doing activities to get rewards in a certain order and playing multiple characters so that you can maximize weekly light level increases. If you're reading this, you probably don't care.

The dynamic is exactly the same once you reach the Powerful cap. When you've hit that cap, only Pinnacle activities will reward items that have light levels above your Maximum Light Level, and the grind becomes really slow. 

## Summary

Here's the bottom line when it comes growing your Light Level:

* Always keep the highest light level item you've obtained for the 18 equipment slots (3 weapon types, plus 5 armor slots per class). It doesn't matter whether you equip or use them.
* Do as many Powerful Reward activities as you can every week until you hit the Powerful Cap (1250)
* Do as many Pinnacle Reward activities every as you can every week until you hit the Pinnacle Cap

If you do those three things you'll get there. In terms of upgrades, the summary is:

* For PVE, make sure your overall light level and weapons are above the recommended (or required) light level for the activities you'll be doing
* For PVP, your seasonal artifact bonus doesn't count
* For PVP, if you don't care about activities where light advantages are enabled, don't worry about light level. If you do, then you want to upgrade the items you'll use to your maximum light level to gain the most advantage
* There's no reason to upgrade an item if you won't be using it in an activity where its light level will be a liability
